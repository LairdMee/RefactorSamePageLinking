# RefactorSamePageLinking

The navigation bar was updated, using Bootstrap classes such as the "navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-light bg-light".

A "back" button was created on each of the three pages: about, product, and checkout - so that the user has the option of returning to the home/main page.
